Last week we attended the European summit for Identity Relationship Management (which (IRM) is not just a new, fancier name for Identity and Access Management (IAM) as it turns out, but more. 
Some quick notes:

First of all, Ludo has a concise summary of the two and a half days here: [Ludo's Blog](http://ludopoitou.wordpress.com/2014/11/10/highlights-of-irmsummit-europe-2014/). Him being a photo enthusiast too, there are [pictures too](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ludovicpoitou/sets/72157649171553675/). Can you find us on one of them?

My personal favourite presentation was Ian Glazer's (Salesforce) contemplating whether we already [have a round wheel](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41093079). Interesting topics, great presentation style, unconventional slides.
