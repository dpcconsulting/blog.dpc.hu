Last week we attended the European summit for Identity Relationship Management (which (IRM) is not just a new, fancier name for Identity and Access Management (IAM) as it turns out, but more. 
Some quick notes:

First of all, Ludo has a concise summary of the two and a half days here: [Ludo's Blog](http://ludopoitou.wordpress.com/2014/11/10/highlights-of-irmsummit-europe-2014/). Him being a photo enthusiast too, there are [pictures too](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ludovicpoitou/sets/72157649171553675/). Can you find us on one of them?

My personal favourite presentation was Ian Glazer's (Salesforce) contemplating whether we already [have a round wheel](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41093079). Interesting topics, great presentation style, unconventional slides. He also introduced the next logical step after *person*, *organizationalPerson*, *inetOrgPerson*. It is of course *hipsterOrgPerson* Barbara Jensen!

I made a note to myself to check out [Juju](juju.ubuntu.com), a config management tool for the cloud era. We saw a demo too.

Also *encapsecurity* and their multi factor authN with TouchID. Among the technical details we also got to learn that "it's not your attribute if you're not born with it", i.e. "you are not your phone". 

Thanks, organizers, see everyone next year.
